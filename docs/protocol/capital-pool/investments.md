# Investments

Any investment allocations are decided by members through on-chain governance using the [Nexus Mutual Protocol Improvement Proposal (NMPIP)](/governance/protocol-improvement-proposals) format. To date, members have voted to allocate capital pool assets in the following strategies.

## Investment in Lido stETH

In May 2021, the DAO Investment team posted a forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to stakes, and risk of staking, 15,000 ETH in Lido Finance to generate investment returns](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641). After member discussion, this proposal was put to a formal governance vote.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 140](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=140), and 14,997.9999 ETH was staked in Lido Finance, which added [14,998 stETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a127001d3a7840206bef53870209f7f9c6b3df9fd2ba9e872b2ed18728e6d22) to the mutual's capital pool.

In September 2021, the DAO Investment team posted another forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to increase, and risk of increasing, the allocation of Nexus Mutual's capital pool to stETH from the then 15,248 stETH held in the capital pool to 30,000 stETH](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641), representing 18.5% of the total capital pool.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 157](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=157), and 14,713.2999 ETH was staked in Lido Finance, which added [14,713.30 stETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5afe54104e9932c3d7390df71416eb41e4ffe915e2c33e9d560b69234e332539) to the capital pool.

## Investment in M11 Credit's wETH lending pool on Maple Finance

In May 2022, the DAO Investment team posted a forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to allocate, and risk of allocating, 15,348 ETH to the M11 Credit wETH lending pool on Maple Finance](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-allocate-capital-to-maple-finance/835/1). After members discussed this proposal and the technical requirements were fulfilled, the proposal was put to a formal governance vote in August 2022.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 172](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=172), and 15,348 ETH was sent to the [Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd), where it was then deposited in the M11 Credit wETH pool on Maple Finance.

## Investment performance

The capital pool contract can be verified on-chain. Anyone can view the crypto assets held in the pool.
* [Capital Pool Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcafea35cE5a2fc4CED4464DA4349f81A122fd12b): 0xcafea35cE5a2fc4CED4464DA4349f81A122fd12b

## Lido Finance rewards history

Lido Finance has a [reward history tool](https://stake.lido.fi/rewards) that anyone can use to see how many stETH have been earned from the mutual's staked ETH. You can enter the mutual's capital pool address into the rewards history tool to see the total earnings from the stETH held in the capital pool.

## Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

[The Enzyme Finance vault has a dashboard](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd) that tracks the capital pool allocation to the M11 Credit wETH lending pool on Maple Finance, where anyone can review the financial performance of the deposit, movement/deployment of funds through the vault, and earnings over time.

In addition, the [Maven 11 wETH pool displayed in the Maple Finance user interface](https://app.maple.finance/#/earn/pool/0x1a066b0109545455bc771e49e6edef6303cb0a93) provides information about the pool, loan history, projected APY for the pool, and more. Read the [announcement](https://medium.com/nexus-mutual/nexus-mutual-utilizes-chainlink-proof-of-reserve-to-verify-deposits-on-maple-finance-integrates-7dd6ee911916) for information on how the protocol uses Chainlink Proof of Reserve to track the price per share of the NXMTY tokens.
