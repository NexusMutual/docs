# Investments

Any investment allocations are decided by members through onchain governance using the [Nexus Mutual Protocol Improvement Proposal (NMPIP)](/governance/protocol-improvement-proposals) format. To date, members have voted to allocate Capital Pool assets in the following strategies.

## Investment in Lido stETH

In May 2021, the DAO Investment team posted a forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to stakes, and risk of staking, 15,000 ETH in Lido Finance to generate investment returns](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641). After member discussion, this proposal was put to a formal governance vote.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 140](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=140), and 14,997.9999 ETH was staked in Lido Finance, which added [14,998 stETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a127001d3a7840206bef53870209f7f9c6b3df9fd2ba9e872b2ed18728e6d22) to the mutual's Capital Pool.

In September 2021, the DAO Investment team posted another forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to increase, and risk of increasing, the allocation of Nexus Mutual's Capital Pool to stETH from the then 15,248 stETH held in the Capital Pool to 30,000 stETH](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-increase-the-allocation-of-the-capital-pool-to-steth/641), representing 18.5% of the total Capital Pool.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 157](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=157), and 14,713.2999 ETH was staked in Lido Finance, which added [14,713.30 stETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5afe54104e9932c3d7390df71416eb41e4ffe915e2c33e9d560b69234e332539) to the Capital Pool.

## Investment in M11 Credit's WETH lending pool on Maple Finance

In May 2022, the DAO Investment team posted a forum proposal that [reviewed the opportunity to allocate, and risk of allocating, 15,348 ETH to the M11 Credit WETH lending pool on Maple Finance](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/proposal-allocate-capital-to-maple-finance/835/1). After members discussed this proposal and the technical requirements were fulfilled, the proposal was put to a formal governance vote in August 2022.
* Members voted in favor of [Proposal 172](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=172), and 15,348 ETH was sent to the [Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd), where it was then deposited in the M11 Credit WETH pool on Maple Finance.
* After the Auros liquidity issue was resolved, [the M11 Credit deposit was withdrawn from the pool](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/m11-credit-weth-pool-updates-and-status-reports/969/5?u=bravenewdefi) and is now held in the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault. Members signaled support to let the Investment team manage the withdrawal process.

## Investment in Rocket Pool (rETH)

In April 2023, uisce.eth shared a Request for Comment (RFC) proposal to allocate 14,400 ETH from the Capital Pool to Rocket Pool (rETH). Uisce.eth reviewed the opportunity to increase, and risk of increasing, the allocation of Nexus Mutual's Capital Pool to rETH, and more. You can review the [[RFC]: Staking with Rocketpool Protocol](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-staking-with-rocketpool-protocol/1064) forum post for the full details. After going through the standard review period, uisce.eth used two Snapshot signaling votes to gauge members' support for this proposal.
* [Signaling Vote: Should the Mutual Stake with Rocketpool (#1)](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0xab65f84dfa13e6860f2c70d975edacf23e7554405839372ff3872127700d1f39)
* [Signaling Vote: Amount of ETH to allocate to Rocketpool (#2)](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0xdf858c753975f9526598f0c201669050fb787b793d99503f80a7e4f2e8ba88ed)

Members signaled their support via Snapshot and this proposal was transitioned to an [NMPIP](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-197-allocate-14-400-eth-to-rocket-pool-protocol-reth/1173), which was then put on chain for a full-member vote.
* Members voted in favor of [NMPIP 197: Stake 14,400 ETH from the Capital Pool in Rocket Pool (rETH)](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=197) and 14,400 ETH was staked with Rocket Pool, which added 13,358 rETH to the Capital Pool.


## Investment in Kiln via the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

In March 2023, Moss from the Avantgarde team shared an [RFC](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-restart-enzyme-vault-diversify-eth-across-staking-providers/1052) on the forum, where he outlined a proposal to allocate the inactive WETH held in the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault to productive positions. The original RFC they posted received feedback from community members encouraging them to limit their scope to ETH staking solutions; Moss took that feedback and posted [[RFC]: Restart Enzyme vault & diversify ETH across staking providers - continued](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-restart-enzyme-vault-diversify-eth-across-staking-providers-continued/1122) on the forum, where the Avantgarde team focused on allocating WETH to Kiln via Enzyme. After going through the standard review period, the Avantgarde team used a Snapshot signaling vote to gauge members' support for this proposal.
* [Signalling Vote: how to proceed with staking on Enzyme vault (first 50% AUM)](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0x2062275bd251ee368d58f6c83e22b457242899d106352073d3c103a69911290d)

Members signaled their support via Snapshot and this proposal was transitioned to an [NMPIP](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-196-restart-enzyme-vault-start-staking-through-kiln-6-624-weth/1174/1), which was then put on chain for a full-member vote.
* Members voted in favor of [NMPIP 196: Stake 6624 WETH from the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault through Kiln](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=196) and 6,624 WETH from the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault (i.e., a portion of the Capital Pool) to Kiln.

The 6,224 WETH was staked in Kiln and is currently accuring staking rewards. See [Avantgarde's latest post](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-196-restart-enzyme-vault-start-staking-through-kiln-6-624-weth/1174/5?u=bravenewdefi) on the governance forum for a status update.

**Note**: the funds invested in Kiln were reallocated to Etherfi's eETH in March 2025 per the outcome of NMPIP 249.

## Investment in Chorus One through Stakewise V3 via the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

In June 2024, the Avantgarde team shared an [RFC](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-stake-idle-eth-on-enzyme-vault-to-chorus-one-through-stakewise-v3/1461) on the forum, where they outlined a proposal to allocate the remaining idle WETH held in the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault into Chorus One's Stakewise V3 vault. The original RFC they posted received feedback from community members and the Investment Committee to put this RFC up for a signalling vote to determine members' appetite to allocate to Chorus One since another proposal to allocate to Etherfi's weETH was also active at this time. After the [signalling vote concluded](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0x376bda4fef544f42799604627791be993d4a050ad49d415c284cc3e2cd6e8b9c), the result showed that members had signalled support for allocating 4,989 ETH to Chorus One via Stakewise V3.

A [joint NMPIP was posted on forum by the Investment Committee](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-228-allocate-6-575-eth-to-chorus-one-and-etherfi/1480/1), which outlined allocating 4,989 ETH to Chorus One via Stakewise V3 and 1,586 ETH to EtherFi by acquiring weETH if NMPIP 228 was approved. The NMPIP went up for vote over a three-day period and members voted to approve the allocation. Subsequently, the allocation was executed by the Avantgarde team in the [Nexus Mutual Enzyme Vault](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd). 

## Investment in Etherfi's weETH via the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

In June 2024, the Etherfi team shared an [RFC](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-stake-idle-eth-on-enzyme-vault-to-ether-fi/1464) on the forum, where they outlined a proposal to allocate the remaining idle WETH held in the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault to Etherfi via weETH. The original RFC they posted received feedback from community members and the Investment Committee to put this RFC up for a signalling vote to determine members' appetite to allocate to Etherfi via weETH since another proposal to Chorus One via Stakewise V3 was also active at this time. After the [signalling vote concluded](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0x376bda4fef544f42799604627791be993d4a050ad49d415c284cc3e2cd6e8b9c), the result showed that members had signalled support for allocating 1,586 ETH to Etherfi via weETH.

A [joint NMPIP was posted on forum by the Investment Committee](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-228-allocate-6-575-eth-to-chorus-one-and-etherfi/1480/1), which outlined allocating 4,989 ETH to Chorus One via Stakewise V3 and 1,586 ETH to EtherFi by acquiring weETH if NMPIP 228 was approved. The NMPIP went up for vote over a three-day period and members voted to approve the allocation. Subsequently, the allocation was executed by the Avantgarde team in the [Nexus Mutual Enzyme Vault](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd). 

## Investment in Etherfi's eETH via the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

In February 2025, the Etherfi team shared an [RFC](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/rfc-stake-kiln-eth-in-enzyme-vault-on-ether-fi/1695) on the forum, where they outlined a proposal to allocate the WETH staked in Kiln via the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault to Etherfi via eETH. The proposal was live on the forum for two weeks and no critical feedback was provided. The comments provided by members were supportive and this RFC transitioned to a formal NMPIP.

In March 2025 the Etherfi team posted [NMPIP: Stake Kiln ETH in Enzyme Vault on ether.fi](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nmpip-stake-kiln-eth-in-enzyme-vault-on-ether-fi/1708/1) on the forum, which outlined reallocating the 6,784 WETH staked in Kiln to Etherfi's eETH if [NMPIP 249](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=249) was approved. The NMPIP went up for vote over a three-day period and members voted to approve the allocation. Subsequently, the allocation was executed by the Avantgarde team in the [Nexus Mutual Enzyme Vault](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd).

## Investment performance

The Capital Pool contract can be verified onchain. Anyone can view the crypto assets held in the pool.
* [Capital Pool Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcafeaf6ea90cb931ae43a8cf4b25a73a24cf6158): 0xcafeaf6eA90CB931ae43a8Cf4B25a73a24cF6158

You can also find the [Investment Committee's monthly updates on the Capital Pool investment performance](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/c/investment/22) on the forum.

## Lido Finance rewards history

Lido Finance has a [reward history tool](https://stake.lido.fi/rewards) that anyone can use to see how many stETH have been earned from the Mutual's staked ETH. You can enter the Mutual's Capital Pool address into the rewards history tool to see the total earnings from the stETH held in the Capital Pool.

## Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault

[The Enzyme Finance vault has a dashboard](https://app.enzyme.finance/vault/0x27f23c710dd3d878fe9393d93465fed1302f2ebd) that tracked the initial Capital Pool allocation to the M11 Credit WETH lending pool on Maple Finance. The funds were withdrawn from the M11 Credit WETH pool in February 2023 and 50% of the WETH held in the Nexus Mutual Enzyme vault has been allocated to ETH staking with Kiln. Anyone can review the financial performance of the vault, movement/deployment of funds through the vault, and earnings over time.
