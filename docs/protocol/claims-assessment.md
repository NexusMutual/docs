# Claim Assessment

<!-- @check Assessments.minVotingPeriod = 3 days -->
<!-- @check Claims.CLAIM_DEPOSIT_IN_ETH = 0.05 ether -->
Nexus Mutual pays claims through an expert-led assessment process. You submit a claim in the Nexus Mutual app, together with a 0.05 ETH claim deposit. The Claims Committee, three publicly known assessors, reviews your evidence and votes on your claim. Some cover products name a Designated Claim Assessor instead. Voting stays open for at least 72 hours. Each assessor casts one vote, and a majority of accept votes approves your claim: 2 of the 3 Committee assessors. After a 24-hour cool-down period, you can redeem an accepted payout for 30 days. Expert assessors have decided every claim since November 2025.

This page describes each step of the Claim Assessment process in detail.

## Submitting a Claim

Nexus Mutual members buy cover to protect themselves against a variety of risks. If you purchase cover to protect your crypto and subsequently suffer a loss, you can file a claim by heading to the **Your Covers** section of the Nexus Mutual app. In that section of the app, you will see an option to select **Claim**, which will take you to the first step of the Claim Submission process.

**Of note**: If you need to file a claim, the Claims Committee members can help you calculate your loss amount and review the details of your claim before you submit the claim onchain. You can reach out to the Claims Committee using the in-app chat or the [Nexus Mutual Contact Form](https://nexusmutual.io/contact). This ensures that you are not missing any information ahead of submitting your claim.

### Step 1: Incident Details

When you select the Claim option on your cover, you will be directed to the Incident Details page (the first step of the Claim Submission process) and asked to provide the details about your loss and any supporting evidence for your claim.

On the Incident Details page, you will see the following fields:
* **Did the loss occur onchain or offchain?**. You will select either **onchain** or **offchain** depending on where your loss occurred.
* **Select the chain where your loss occurred**. If you selected **onchain** in the field above, you will need to select the chain where your loss occurred. There is a drop-down list of the supported chains that you can choose from in this field.
* **Please provide an overview of how the loss occurred**. You will use this field to enter in the details about your loss. Sharing links to your original deposit transactions, the post-mortem report for a hack, etc., are all examples of supporting evidence you can include in this field. The Claims Committee will use the overview and information you provide in this field to validate your claim submission.
* **Please share any files, screenshots, and/or supporting evidence that can help assessors validate your claim**. You can upload images, documents, etc., in this field, which Claims Committee will use to validate your claim.

Once you have entered in all of the incident details, you can proceed to the Proof of Loss step.

### Step 2: Proof of Loss

Nexus Mutual requires cover holders to provide proof of loss when they submit a claim. The proof of loss required varies depending on the cover product. For most of Nexus Mutual's cover products, upfront proof of loss is provided when cover is purchased or added during the active cover period before a loss occurs onchain.

If upfront proof of loss is already available, the Claims Committee will review this information to determine your claim's validity and help you calculate your Claim Amount and prepare for claims filing.

If offchain proof of loss is required, you will see the information required to provide proof of loss in the Nexus Mutual app.
 
Upfront proof of loss will already be on file in the private database. If offchain proof of loss is required, you will be prompted to provide that information before moving to the Reviewing Claim Details step.

### Step 3: Reviewing Your Claim Details

Once you provide the incident details and proof of loss, you will need to review all of the information you have included with your claim. This last step is the final check before you submit your claim onchain for the Claims Committee to review.

Confirm all of the information is correct before proceeding to file your claim. Once you have confirmed, you will file your claim and Nexus Mutual's Claims Committee will review your claim submission.

## Expert-Led Claim Assessment

Nexus Mutual's Claims Committee is responsible for assessing the validity of any claims submitted. There may be cover products with a Designated Claim Assessor that is separate from the Claims Committee; however, the Claims Committee will handle the majority of the claims submitted.

The Claims Committee is made up of publicly known experts with an established record of assessing claims within the Mutual. Currently, Nexus Mutual's Claims Committee has three members:
* **Hugh Karp, Advisory Board Member**. Hugh is Nexus Mutual's founder and brings a wealth of traditional insurance expertise along with half a decade of onchain risk expertise to the Claims Committee.
* **Roxana Danila, Advisory Board Member**. Roxana is Nexus Mutual's CTO and brings engineering and onchain analysis expertise to the Claims Committee.
* **BraveNewDeFi, Head of Risk**. BraveNewDeFi is Head of Risk and has been managing claims incident response since he joined Nexus Mutual in 2021. Brave brings his onchain risk and analysis expertise to the Claims Committee.

These risk experts will review the incident details and proof of loss provided by claimants and use that information to determine whether a claim is valid (meets the terms and conditions outlined in the cover wording) or not valid (does not meet the terms and conditions outlined in the cover wording).

### Assessing Active Claims

Once you submit your claim, the Claims Committee will be alerted and begin their review.

<!-- @check Assessments.minVotingPeriod = 3 days -->
Any claim that is submitted will be open for voting for at least 72 hours. During that 72 hours, the Claims Committee will review the details provided, discuss the validity of your claim, and cast their votes. Each Assessor casts one vote, and a claim is accepted when accept votes outnumber deny votes: 2 of the 3 Claims Committee Assessors.

Once the Claims Committee has cast their votes and the 72-hour period ends, voting on the claim will close.

**Note**: The Claims Committee members are required to provide the rationale behind their decision to accept or deny a claim when they cast their vote. Claimants will be able to review this information after the voting period ends for a claim submission.

## Claim Outcomes

Once voting on a claim has closed, there is a 24-hour cool-down period that must pass before the claim outcome is finalized. This 24-hour period allows the Advisory Board to determine if fraud has occurred during the voting process. If fraud does occur, the Advisory Board has the power to reverse a fraudulent vote and replace any Assessor who engages in fraudulent voting.

### Your Claim is Accepted

If the Claims Committee members review the details and proof of loss provided and determine your claim is valid (meets the terms and conditions outlined in the cover wording), they will vote to accept your claim submission.

If the Claims Committee members vote to accept your claim, you will be able to withdraw your claim payment after the 24-hour post-claim cool-down period ends. After a claim is accepted, you will have 30 days to withdraw your claim payment.

### Your Claim is Denied

If the Claims Committee members review the details and proof of loss you provided and determine your claim is not valid (does not meet the terms and conditions outlined in the cover wording), they will vote to deny your claim submission.

If your claim is denied, you will be able to appeal the decision and file another claim with more supporting evidence and information on why your claim is valid and should be accepted.

## How Claim Assessment Has Changed

Nexus Mutual's claim assessment process has changed twice since the protocol launched in 2019. Many older articles, explainers, and repositories describe the earlier versions. This section maps each version to its dates, so you can tell current information from historical information.

### Who votes on claims?

The Claims Committee votes on claims today. Each of the three assessors casts one vote. At least 2 of the 3 accept votes approve a claim. From 2019 to March 2023 (protocol V1), any member could stake NXM as a Claims Assessor and vote on claims, subject to a 70% consensus threshold. From March 2023 to November 2025 (protocol V2), members staked NXM in the Assessment contract. A stake-weighted majority decided claims. The Claims Committee replaced member staking in November 2025.

### What do I need to submit a claim?

You submit a claim with a 0.05 ETH claim deposit. See the [Claims contract reference](/developers/contracts/Claims) for how the deposit works. Under V1, buying cover locked 10% of the cover price in NXM as a cover note. The cover note served as the claim deposit. The ETH deposit replaced cover notes in March 2023.

### What happened to the 70% consensus threshold and the 36-hour voting window?

<!-- @check Assessments.minVotingPeriod = 3 days -->
Those were V1 rules, retired in March 2023. Today, voting stays open for at least 72 hours. A majority of the three Claims Committee assessors must vote accept.

## Claims History

Nexus Mutual's Claim Assessment process has been battle-tested since 2019 when the protocol first launched. Since then, the Mutual has paid out millions of dollars worth of claims to members who purchased cover and subsequently suffered a loss.
