# The Nexus Mutual Protocol

Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance alternative that allows people to join as members and share risk with others. Members can purchase cover products that protect against various risks. The protocol is built on Ethereum and provides the infrastructure for members to build risk management businesses.

Members coordinate with one another through the Nexus Mutual protocol.
