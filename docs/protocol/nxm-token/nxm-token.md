# NXM Token

The NXM token is a governance and utility token backed by crypto assets held in the capital pool contract. When someone contributes ETH or DAI to the capital pool in the [Nexus Mutual user interface](https://app.nexusmutual.io/swap), NXM is minted and transferred to their wallet.

Members can custody and use NXM within the protocol to participate in:
* **Onchain governance**. NXM holders use the token to vote in onchain governance, where members make critical decisions about protocol upgrades, capital pool investment allocations, and how capital pool assets are used. Learn more in the [Governance](/governance/) section.
* **DAO governance**. Members decide how DAO treasury funds are used by discussing proposals and voting with their NXM. Learn more in the [Governance](/governance/) section.
* **Staking**. NXM powers the underwriting process, where members can stake and delegate their NXM to a pool or assess risk and manage a staking pool. By staking NXM, they create open capacity for other members to buy cover. When cover is purchased, NXM stakers are rewarded with a share of the cover fee in NXM. Learn more in the [Staking](/protocol/staking/) section. 
* **Claims assessment**. Members stake NXM and participate in the claims assessment process. When someone stakes NXM, this is subject to a lockup period, which allows the protocol to protect against any attacks on the assessment process. Those who vote fraudulently can have their staked NXM burned by the Advisory Board. Learn more in the [Claims Assessment](/protocol/claims-assessment) section.

For a detailed breakdown of the NXM supply, number of NXM holders, NXM distribution and more, see the [Capital Pool and Ownership Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/nexus_mutual/capital-pool-and-ownership) created by the R&D and Marketing DAO teams.
