# Cover Products

Members can purchase cover products that protect against various risks. Currently, the mutual offers a variety of cover products for crypto-native risks. The protocol does support product development for new types of cover, such as cover for real world risk and other types of crypto-native risk.

Members can choose from five crypto-native cover products:
* [**Protocol Cover**](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover). For crypto assets deposited in a single protocol deployed on EVM-compatible networks.
  * Protection against a range of loss events caused by exploits, oracle price manipulation, economic design failure, and governance attacks
* [**ETH Staking Cover**](/overview/cover-products/eth-staking-cover). For validator operators who are staking ETH.
  * Protection against penalties, slashing events, and missed rewards
* [**Custody Cover**](/overview/cover-products/custody-cover). For crypto assets deposited on a centralized crypto custodian.
  * Protection against custodial hacks and custodial withdrawals that are halted for more than 90 days
* [**Yield Token Cover**](/overview/cover-products/yield-token-cover). For crypto assets deposited into a vault strategy that is exposed to multiple protocols.
  * Protection for yield-bearing tokens against any loss event that causes the yield token's market value to depeg from its intended value (i.e., face value)
* [**Excess Cover**](/overview/cover-products/excess-cover). For crypto-native cover providers and other protection providers.
  * Protection for underlying risk covered by a cover provider
