# Cover Products

Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. Currently, the Mutual offers a variety of cover products for onchain risks and real world risks. The protocol does support product development for new types of cover, such as cover for real world risk and other types of onchain risk.

Members can choose from various onchain cover products:
* [**Protocol Cover**](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover). For onchain assets deposited in a single protocol deployed on EVM-compatible networks.
  * Protection against a range of loss events caused by smart contract hacks/exploits, oracle manipulation or failure, severe liquidation failures, and governance takeovers.
* [**ETH Slashing Cover**](/overview/cover-products/eth-slashing-cover). For node and validator operators.
  * Protection against slashing penalties.
* [**Quota Share Cover**](/overview/cover-products/quota-share-cover). For onchain cover providers and other protection providers.
  * Protection for underlying risk underwritten by a cover provider.

In the following pages, you can learn more about each of Nexus Mutual's cover products and the development process for new cover products.
