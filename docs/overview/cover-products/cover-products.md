# Cover Products

Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. Currently, the mutual offers a variety of cover products for crypto-native risks. The protocol does support product development for new types of cover, such as cover for real world risk and other types of crypto-native risk.

Members can choose from five crypto-native cover products:
* [**Protocol Cover**](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover). For crypto assets deposited in a single protocol deployed on EVM-compatible networks.
  * Protection against a range of loss events caused by exploits, oracle price manipulation, economic design failure, and governance attacks.
* [**ETH Slashing Cover**](/overview/cover-products/eth-staking-cover). For validator operators who are staking ETH.
  * Protection against penalties and slashing events.
* [**Excess Cover**](/overview/cover-products/excess-cover). For crypto-native cover providers and other protection providers.
  * Protection for underlying risk covered by a cover provider.

In the following pages, you can learn more about each of Nexus Mutual's cover products and the development process for new cover products.
