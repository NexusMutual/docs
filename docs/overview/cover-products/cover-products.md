# Cover Products

Members can purchase cover products that protect against different kinds of risk. Currently, the Mutual offers a variety of cover products for crypto-native risks. The protocol does support product development for new types of cover, such as cover for real world risk and other types of crypto-native risk.

Members can choose from various crypto-native cover products:
* [**Protocol Cover**](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover). For crypto assets deposited in a single protocol deployed on EVM-compatible networks.
  * Protection against a range of loss events caused by smart contract code bugs/errors and Sudden and Severe Economic Events, which include oracle manipulation or failure, severe liquidation failures, or governance takeovers.
* [**ETH Slashing Cover**](/overview/cover-products/eth-slashing-cover). For node and validator operators who are managing staked ETH.
  * Protection against slashing penalties.
* [**Quota Share Cover**](/overview/cover-products/quota-share-cover). For crypto-native cover providers and other protection providers.
  * Protection for underlying risk covered by a cover provider.
