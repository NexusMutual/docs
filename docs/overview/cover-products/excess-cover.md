# Excess Cover

Crypto-native cover providers and other providers can protect their underwriting capital against the underlying risks they offer coverage for.

## Risks covered

Crypto-native cover providers and other providers underwrite coverage for various risks, which can result in claim payouts that reduce their underwriting capital.

Excess Cover allows other cover providers to shift a portion of their risk exposure onto the mutual.

This is a bespoke product that can be created for individual cover providers.

## Sherlock Excess Cover wording

Currently, Nexus Mutual provides [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), auditing and smart contract coverage protocol, with Excess Cover. For more information, read the full terms and conditions of [Nexus Mutual’s Sherlock Excess Cover](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62d8193ce9880895261daf4a/63d0f7c4f0864e48c46ad93c_SherlockExcessCoverv1.0.pdf).

Nexus Mutual’s claims assessors use this cover wording as a reference when considering any claim.

### Proof of loss

When Excess Cover is purchased, an organization would include a list of the risks they offer protection for along with the agreed upon underlying cover amount.

If a claim is filed, the covered organization would provide evidence that claims have been paid. This can be on-chain or off-chain proof of loss, depending on which organization holds active Excess Cover.

For Sherlock Excess Cover, proof of claim payments would be provided on-chain.

## Claims process

When a covered organization pays out claims for an underlying risk that is included in the Excess Cover wording, they can file a claim in the Nexus Mutual user interface.

Your organization will need to wait 72 hours for the cool-down period to pass. The cool-down period applies for Excess Cover claims.

1. Your organization will file a claim using evidence of their claim payments for the covered underlying risks.
    * The claim payments must exceed the agreed upon deductible during a 90-day period.
    * For Sherlock Excess Cover, the deductible is $500,000.

2. Claims assessors will review, discuss, and vote to approve claims where proof of loss shows that your organization has indeed paid out claims for covered underlying risks above the deductible.
    * If the claim is approved, your organization will be able to redeem the payout.
    * If the claim is denied, your organization will be able to file another claim with more supporting evidence.

For a review of the claims assessment process, see the [Claims Assessment](/protocol/claims-assessment) section.
