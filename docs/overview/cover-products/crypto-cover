# Crypto Cover

Crypto Cover is a modular cover product that offers several different coverage options within one wording document. This allows the Product & Risk team to bundle different types of coverage into one (1) single listing.

## Covered Risks

Crypto Cover  allows the Mutual to offer:
* **Part A: Custody Cover**. Protection against a loss of funds due to crime-related loss and halted withdrawals of more than 100 days on centralized exchanges and crypto custodians. Available for purchases of $1M or more.
* **Part B: Single Protocol Cover & Multi Protocol Cover**. Protection against a loss of funds due to smart contract hacks/exploits, oracle failure, oracle manipulation, liquidation failure, and governance takeovers.
* **Part C: Depeg Cover**. Protection against a defined loss of value (i.e., the Depeg Percentage) over a defined amount of time (i.e., the Depeg Time). In simple terms, this coverage protects against a depeg event that lasts more than several days.
* **Part D: Slashing Cover**. Protection for proof-of-stake (PoS) validators and native token stakers against penalties and slashing events.

Nexus Mutual's claim assessors use this cover wording as a reference when considering any Crypto Cover claim.

### Proof of Loss

When you hold Crypto Cover and suffer a loss, you can file a claim and claim assessors will review your claim submission to determine whether your claim is valid.

For Crypto Cover claims, proof of loss is required. See the [Crypto Cover wording](https://api.nexusmutual.io/ipfs/QmaR79gHuSzU371e7V6EEk1V14ohDm2Hk25FFuRgk9vrfx) for details on the required proof of loss for each different cover offering included with this product.

## Claim Filing Process

After a loss event occurs, you will need to wait for the Cool-Down Period to pass. The Cool-Down Period is defined for each coverage offering in the Crypto Cover wording.

The cool-down period applies for Crypto Cover claims, per the cover wording.
1. If you hold Crypto Cover at the time the loss event occurs, you can submit a claim with supporting evidence, otherwise referred to as proof of loss.
    * You will be able to include written details, links to supporting documentation, and/or upload screenshots or other files in the Incident Details portion of the claim submission process
    * You will provide proof of loss, as detailed in the Crypto Cover wording depending on which part of the wording is included in the annex.
2. Claim assessors will review, discuss and vote to approve claims where proof of loss shows that you have indeed suffered a loss.
    * If your claim is approved, you will be able to redeem your claim payout after the 24-hour post-claim period passes in the Your Covers menu. You can also check your Dashboard to see the status of any active claims.
    * If your claim is denied, you will be able to file another claim with more supporting evidence
