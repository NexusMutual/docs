# FAQ

## Basics

### What is Nexus Mutual?

Nexus Mutual is an insurance alternative that operates as a discretionary mutual, where people can join as members and share risk with others. Members can participate in various roles, such as NXM stakers, who underwrite cover; cover buyers, who purchase protection to hedge against risk; and claims assessors, who stake NXM and review filed claims.

It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance company because it is wholly owned by the members.

Learn more in the [Overview](/overview/) section.

### What does "risk sharing" mean?

All members and NXM holders collectively own the capital pool and its assets. By acting as a member and holding NXM, you are pooling capital and sharing risk with others. When claims are paid, members who stake NXM can have their stake burned to facilitate claim payouts, which flow out from the capital pool.

Everyone within the mutual pools capital and shares risk.

Learn more in the [Protocol](/protocol/) section.

### Does Nexus Mutual offer "insurance"?

Nexus Mutual cover is not a contract of insurance. Cover is provided on a discretionary basis with Nexus Mutual members having the final say on which claims are paid. Members are putting trust in the economic incentive model rather than an insurance company.

Nexus Mutual is a discretionary mutual: a mutual fund that provides discretionary cover, which is an insurance-like product that involves only a discretion, not a legal obligation, to pay out on the occurrence of a material loss.

### What risks do you cover?

Nexus Mutual provides a variety of cover products including:
* [Protocol Cover](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover)
* [Custody Cover](/overview/cover-products/custody-cover)
* [Yield Token Cover](/overview/cover-products/yield-token-cover)

For a full list of Nexus Mutual's cover products, see the [Cover Products](/overview/cover-products/) page.

### What loss events are covered?

* [Protocol Cover](/overview/cover-products/protocol-cover) protects against a range of loss events caused by exploits, oracle price manipulation, economic design failure, and governance attacks.
* [Custody Cover](/overview/cover-products/custody-cover) protects against custodial hacks and custodial withdrawals that are halted for more than 90 days.
* [Yield Token Cover](/overview/cover-products/yield-token-cover) protects against any loss event that causes the yield token's market value to depeg from its intended value (i.e., face value).

You can review the products in detail in the [Cover Products](/overview/cover-products/) section.

### Can I buy cover for assets in wallets other than my whitelisted address?

Yes, you can. You need to buy cover using the ETH address you used to sign up for membership (i.e. your whitelisted address). Cover is purchased with that address but you can protect assets in other wallets.
If you suffer a loss of funds and need to file a claim, you will need to submit proof of loss, which differs for each [cover product](/overview/cover-products/).

### How do I get my protocol listed on Nexus Mutual?

If you're interested in having your protocol reviewed for a potential listing in the Nexus Mutual user interface, you can use the following [contact form](https://nexusmutual.io/contact) to provide your request, which the product team will review and determine if a listing is appropriate at this time.

## Claims

### Have any claims been paid?

To date, members have more than $9.34m to cover holders who suffered a loss due to past exploits, technical failures, and halted withdrawals on a centralized custodian.

### How do I know my claim will be paid?

The Claims Assessment process is designed to prevent anyone from submitting fraudulent votes. The claims process is battled-tested and has been used to review and approve more than $9.34m in claims to date.

Because members have to stake NXM to participate in the Claims Assessment process, they risk having their stake burned if they vote fraudulently. See the [Claims Assessment](/protocol/claims-assessment#fraudulent-votes) section for more details on the security of the claims process.

### When is loss of funds (in DAI or ETH) determined for a claim?

Loss is determined at different times for different cover types:
* **Protocol Cover**. Loss is determined just before the time the loss of funds occurred.
* **Custody Cover**. Loss is determined either at:
  * The time the custodial hack occurs; or
  * The 90-day point if withdrawals are halted

See the [Cover Products](/overview/cover-products/) section for more information about loss.

### How do I provide proof of loss?

Proof of loss is different for each cover product. You can find information on proof of loss on each page within the [Cover Products](/overview/cover-products/) section.

### How long does the Claims Assessment process take?

From the time you submit your claim, it usually takes between three and six days for claims assessors to review, vote, and determine a claim's outcome.

## Staking

### What does it mean to delegate my staked NXM?

When you stake your NXM, you can choose to allow a staking pool manager the ability to allocate and stake your NXM against different cover products. You also delegate your voting power for protocol governance to the staking pool manager.

Learn more in the [Staking](/protocol/staking/) section. 

### What is a staking period?

A staking period is the length of time you choose to lockup your staked NXM in a staking pool of your choosing.

Learn more in the [Staking](/protocol/staking/#staking-periods) section. 

### What are the risks of staking NXM?

Your NXM can be burned to facilitate claim payouts if members who purchased cover from the staking pool file successful claims.

If a claim is filed and approved by claims assessors, then the staked NXM allocated to the relevant cover product is burned proportionally across all stakers.

Learn more in the [Staking](/protocol/staking/#risk-of-nxm-burns) section. 

## Governance

### How can I get involved in Nexus Mutual governance?

You can stay active and engaged on the [Nexus Mutual governance forum](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/) and learn how to start a discussion or raise a proposal by reviewing the [Governance](/governance/) section. 

### Does Nexus Mutual have a grants program?

If you wish to contribute to the DAO by working on a single-purpose project, providing a short-term service, building tools for members, or other means, you can submit a grant-specific [Nexus Mutual DAO Proposal](/governance/dao-proposals#grant-request).

### How can I contribute to the DAO?

There are a variety of ways to contribute to the mutual and the DAO. Learn more about how the [Nexus Mutual DAO](/governance/dao) operates and how you can contribute.

## NXM Token

### Why do you need the NXM token?

The NXM token is needed in order to bind together the internal economics of the mutual, so that the platform can:
* Dynamically react to the prevailing conditions and capitalization levels; and
* Reward active members for participating in the day-to-day operations of the mutual

### When did the NXM token launch?

Nexus Mutual and the NXM token were launched on 30 May 2019. You can read our [Weâ€™ve Launched](https://medium.com/nexus-mutual/weve-launched-2bc8ba1049f2) Medium post for details about the initial launch. You can check out the [Nexus Mutual user interface](https://app.nexusmutual.io/home) as well.

### Is NXM listed on any exchanges?

The NXM token is not listed on exchanges and the mutual does not expect to list NXM on exchanges in the future. Due to the nature of the token model and the requirement for tokens to belong to members only, any exchange listing would have to be bespoke.

Tokens will be redeemable directly from within the Nexus Mutual user interface for ETH, subject to [some restrictions](/protocol/nxm-token/token-model#redemption-and-purchase-restrictions).

### Can I transfer NXM tokens?

Yes, as long as the address being transferred to is also a Nexus Mutual member; the transaction will fail if this is not the case.

### What is the difference between NXM and wNXM?

#### NXM vs. wNXM

NXM can only be traded among members, while wNXM is fully tradeable but can't be used at all within the Nexus Mutual protocol.

wNXM is a 1-to-1 backed token that can only be generated by wrapping genuine NXM.

Only Nexus Mutual members can wrap/unwrap NXM using the [Nexus Mutual Wrapper](https://nexus-wrapper.netlify.app/).

#### NXM vs. wNXM price differences

NXM can only be purchased via the [Nexus Mutual user interface](https://app.nexusmutual.io/home) as it isn't listed on any exchanges. NXM can only be held and traded by members of the mutual.

The NXM token is priced using the [token model](/protocol/nxm-token/token-model).

When wNXM is sold on decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges, the price is subject to market forces.

You can check the [wNXM supply on Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/queries/6400/12708). This dashboard was created by [Nexus Mutual member Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39).

#### Why is the price different between wNXM and NXM?

While wNXM is backed 1-to-1 with genuine NXM, the two tokens are priced by different factors. This can result in a price disparity under certain conditions.

### Where can I verify the wNXM supply?

You can verify the wNXM supply by viewing the [wNXM smart contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d438f3b5175bebc262bf23753c1e53d03432bde).

* wNXM contract address: 0x0d438F3b5175Bebc262bF23753C1E53d03432bDE
