# FTX Halted Withdrawals | November 2022

## Total claims paid

A total of $4.9m was paid out for Claims 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 176, and 178.

## Overview

After FTX halted withdrawals in November 2022, members who held FTX Custody Cover at the time withdrawals were first halted waited for the 90-day period to pass. [Section 1.2 of the Custody Cover wording](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62d8193ce9880895261daf4a/63d0f4d7b378db634f0f9a9d_CustodyCoverWordingv1.0.pdf) provides protection for assets that cannot be withdrawn from a centralized exchange after more than 90 days has passed.

During this time, members documented their losses and prepared for claims filing. Before the 90-day period ended, a [guide to FTX claims filing](https://nexusmutual.io/blog/how-ftx-custody-cover-holders-can-prepare-for-claims-filing) was shared across the mutual's social channels. 

After 90 days passed, withdrawals were still halted on FTX. On Monday, 6 February 2023, members began filing claims for the FTX loss event. As claims were filed, members staked NXM to participate in the [Claims Assessment](https://docs.nexusmutual.io/protocol/claims-assessment) process. Claims assessors discussed claims in the Nexus Mutual Discord and kept track of eligible covers in the [FTX Claims Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DvBE95LUuOY5B4pJZoXG8SbXUIWvYsXaYkk70DHAh6E/edit?usp=sharing).

## Filed claims and outcomes

Twenty-three (23) claims were filed and voted on by claims assessors. Since this loss event met the terms outlined in Section 1.2 of the Custody Cover wording, claims assessors reviewed the validity of the claims to determine:

* Was the member's FTX Custody Cover active at the time withdrawals were first halted?
* Did the member provide off-chain proof of loss with their claim?
* Did the member verify ownership of their FTX account?

### Approved claims

Claims assessors reviewed and approved Claims 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 176, and 178. These claims included proof of loss, which showed each affected member suffered a loss due to halted withdrawals.

### Denied claims

Claims assessors reviewed and denied Claims 146, 148, and 175.

Claim 146 was filed before the 90-day period had passed, and this cover expired on 13 October 2022. Because the cover expired before withdrawals were halted and it was filed before withdrawals had been halted for more than 90 days, claims assessors voted to deny this claim.

Claim 148 was filed before the 90-day period had passed, and claims assessors voted to deny this claim for that reason. The member who filed this claim waited until the 90-day period passed and filed a second claim (Claim 158), which claims assessors approved and paid.

Claim 175 was filed with a requested claim amount that was higher than the actual loss amount. Because the requested claim amount was higher than the actual loss, claims assessors voted to deny this claim. The member who filed this claim submitted a second claim, where the requested claim amount matched the actual loss. After reviewing this second submission, claims assessors voted to approve and pay this claim.

### FTX bankruptcy and reimbursement

Members who filed a claim and received a payout agreed to the following terms:

<blockquote>By making a successful claim and receiving a payout (i.e., reimbursement) from Nexus Mutual, you agree to give rights to any future reimbursements from the FTX bankruptcy proceedings — including any future reimbursement tokens distributed as part of the FTX bankruptcy settlement — to Nexus Mutual, per the recoveries provision in Section 3 in the Custody Cover wording: https://nexusmutual.io/pages/CustodyCoverWordingv1.0.pdf.</blockquote>

The Community team is in the process of working with members who received claim payouts to transfer the bankruptcy claims to the mutual, so any future reimbursement can be returned to the capital pool.
