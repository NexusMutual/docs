# TribeDAO, Rari Capital Fuse Market Hack | 30 April 2022

## Total Claim Payouts
A total of $5.08m was paid out for Claims 110, 111, and 113.

## Overview
After this exploit occurred, claims assessors [discussed this loss event](https://discord.com/channels/496296560624140298/689385874265342056/970676366238425098) in the mutual's Discord server. Because Nexus Mutual is a discretionary mutual, members participate in the [Claims Assessment](/protocol/claims-assessment/) process and review the validity of claims submitted after a loss event occurs.

Members reviewed the information available in the days after the exploit, while Rari Capital Protocol Cover holders waited for the 72-hour cool-down period to pass before submitting claims. Claims assessors discussed the event and determined the Rari Capital Fuse market exploit was covered under sections 1.1 of the [Protocol Cover wording](https://nexusmutual.io/pages/ProtocolCoverv1.0.pdf).

Once the 72-hour cool-down period had passed, the mutual [released a statement](https://twitter.com/NexusMutual/status/1521481408967061508) with instructions on How to File a Claim, as well as information about the active covers and the Claims Assessment process. Within this announcement, there is a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haZshQwcYASEGnVRmE5AWC_iNWRLibqRNT7y94Jh63E/edit#gid=0) that contains Rari Capital active covers where information has been included about claims members voted to accept, deny, or claims that were not filed.

### Filed claims and outcomes
To date, two (2) claims have been filed and voted on by claims assessors. As stated in the section above, claims assessors had determined this was a covered event. Once it has been determined that an event is covered, claims assessors review the validity of claims to determine:
* Did the member have active cover at the time of the exploit?
* Did the member provide proof of loss?
* Did the member lose 20% or more of the covered amount?

#### Approved claims
Claims assessors reviewed and approved Claims [110](https://app.nexusmutual.io/claim-assessment/view-claim?claimId=110), [111](https://app.nexusmutual.io/claim-assessment/view-claim?claimId=111), and [113](https://app.nexusmutual.io/claim-assessment/view-claim?claimId=113). The claims included proof of loss, which showed the affected addresses where the members suffered a loss of 20% or greater.
