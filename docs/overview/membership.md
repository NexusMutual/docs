# Membership

The Nexus Mutual DAO operates as a discretionary mutual where people are required to join as members before they can interact with the protocol or contribute within the DAO.

As a member, you can buy cover, contribute capital to the mutual in exchange for NXM tokens, and earn rewards from staking NXM, managing staking pools, assessing claims, and participating in on-chain governance.

## Benefits of membership

Members own the capital pool, contribute to the mutual, and control the protocol through on-chain governance.

Members can:
* Buy discretionary cover products
* Share risk with other members
* Contribute funds to the mutual and hold NXM tokens
* Stake NXM, underwrite risk, and earn rewards
* Stake NXM, assess claims, and earn rewards
* Create and run risk management businesses
* Put forward and vote on governance proposals
* Contribute to the Nexus Mutual DAO

## Becoming a member

Before you complete the membership process, be sure to read the membership agreement and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.

While the wallet address you use for your whitelisted membership address can be changed later on, it's strongly recommended that you use a [hardware wallet](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations/) to generate an address and use that as your membership address.

### Membership agreement

By becoming a member you agree to the conditions specified in the [DAO Member Agreement]([https://nexusmutual.io/pages/Nexus-Mutual-DAO-Member-Agreement-FIN.pdf](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62d8193ce9880895261daf4a/63d0f45aacb2752b543ddcaf_Nexus-Mutual-DAO-Member-Agreement-FIN.pdf).

* **KYC / AML**. To become a member, you will need to verify your identity through the Know-Your-Customer / Anti-Money-Laundering process. If this fails, you wonâ€™t be able to join the mutual.
* **You pay an initial membership fee**. Membership costs 0.0020 ETH and is required for anyone who joins the mutual.
* **You own part of the mutual**. You can buy cover and earn more NXM by helping run the mutual, including voting on claims, staking NXM, and voting on proposals.

### KYC requirements

To become a member, you will need to verify your identity through the KYC process.

1. First, select the **Pay membership fee** button on the [Welcome page](https://app.nexusmutual.io/home).
2. Pay the 0.0020 ETH fee and proceed to the KYC submission process.
3. You will be prompted to submit a photo of your government-issued identification, which will be used in the verification process.
