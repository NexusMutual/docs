# Membership

The Nexus Mutual DAO operates as a discretionary mutual where people are required to join as members before they can interact with the protocol or contribute within the DAO.

## Benefits of membership

Members own the Capital Pool, contribute to the Mutual, and control the protocol through on-chain governance.

Members can:
* Buy discretionary cover products
* Share risk with other members
* Contribute funds to the Mutual and hold NXM tokens
* Stake NXM, underwrite risk, and earn rewards
* Stake NXM, assess claims, and earn rewards
* Create and run risk management businesses
* Put forward and vote on governance proposals
* Contribute to the Nexus Mutual DAO

## Becoming a member

Before you complete the membership process, be sure to read the membership agreement and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.

While the Ethereum address you use for your registered membership address can be changed later on, it's strongly recommended that you use a [hardware wallet](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/hardware-wallet-recommendations/) to generate an address that will be used as your membership address.

### Membership agreement

By becoming a member you agree to the conditions specified in the [DAO Member Agreement](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62d8193ce9880895261daf4a/63d0f45aacb2752b543ddcaf_Nexus-Mutual-DAO-Member-Agreement-FIN.pdf).

* **KYC / AML**. To become a member, you will need to verify your identity through the Know-Your-Customer / Anti-Money-Laundering process. If this fails, you won’t be able to join the Mutual.
* **You pay an initial membership fee**. Membership costs 0.0020 ETH and is required for anyone who joins the Mutual.
* **You own part of the Mutual**. You can buy cover and earn more NXM by helping run the Mutual, including voting on claims, staking NXM, and voting on proposals.

### KYC requirements

To become a member, you will need to verify your identity.

1. First, select the (Membership) button on the [Welcome page](https://app.nexusmutual.io/).
2. Proceed to KYC submission: you will be prompted to submit a photo of your government-issued identification, which will be used in the verification process.
3. Pay the 0.0020 ETH fee and finalize your membership.

**Unfortunately, the Nexus Mutual DAO cannot accept members from the following jurisdictions.** We are working hard to reduce this list in the future.
