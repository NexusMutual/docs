# Nexus Mutual DAO Proposals

A Nexus Mutual DAO Proposal (NMDP) is a proposal that can be used to submit a grant request for funding, create a new DAO team, or request a renewal and funding for an existing DAO team. These proposals are used to engage with the community, reach consensus, and distribute funding from the DAO treasury to fund projects and teams.

Members can post, discuss, and vote on proposals using Snapshot. Proposals fall into one of the following categories. 

## Grant request

Members that wish to contribute to the DAO by working on single-purpose projects, providing short-term services, building tools for members, or other means can submit a grant-specific NMDP. The required information for a grant-specific NMDP is included in the [NMDP template](/governance/dao-proposals#nmdp-templates) entry.

## DAO team creation request

If a member, or group of members, believe another team can provide long-term value to the DAO, protocol, and members on a whole, they can write and post a team creation request NMDP. The required information for a team creation request NMDP is included in the [NMDP template](/governance/dao-proposals#nmdp-templates) entry. Learn more about the process on the [Nexus Mutual DAO](/governance/dao#proposing-a-new-team) page.

## DAO team funding request

If an established team is nearing the end of their funding period, they can create a team funding request NMDP. The required information for a team funding request NMDP is included in the [NMDP template](/governance/dao-proposals#nmdp-templates) entry. Learn more about the process on the [Nexus Mutual DAO](/governance/dao#requesting-funding-for-an-existing-team) page.

## NMDP governance process

Any potential governance change should start as a Request for Comment (RFC) before a protocol improvement proposal is raised. Creating a Nexus Mutual DAO Proposal (NMDP) is the second step in the protocol governance process. Any member can start RFC discussions, create, post, and vote on NMDPs.

### 1. Posting a RFC

Every governance discussion should start as a Request for Comment (RFC) to get feedback from the community and, if applicable, the Investment team.

RFCs should be posted for at least 12 days before they are raised as formal NMDPs. Of course, they can be posted for longer periods, but a minimum is necessary to ensure members have adequate time to give feedback ahead of a formal proposal. This feedback can be used to revise your proposal ahead of a NMDP posting.

The format for RFCs is an abbreviated version of the NMDP format:

**Title**. [RFC]: [Concise title for proposal]. For example: <code>[RFC]: Should we give BootNode a grant to design an ERC-4626 compliant covered vault?</code>

**Summary**. Short summary, no more than 250 words, of your proposal.

**Rationale**. Explain why your proposal is important: what problem does it solve?

**Specification**. The what and how of your proposal. What is the purpose of your proposal and how does it solve the stated problem, benefit members, or improve the DAO or protocol?

### 2. Posting an NMDP

When you write an NMDP, you should include the required information, which is specific to the NMDP type. At a minimum, you must include:

**Title**. NMDP: [Concise title for proposal]. For example: <code>NMDP: Should we give BootNode a grant to design an ERC-4626 compliant covered vault?</code>

**Summary**. Short summary, no more than 250 words, of your proposal.

**Specification**. The what and how of your proposal. What is the purpose of your proposal and how does it solve the stated problem, benefit members, or improve the DAO or protocol?

**Budget request**. If funds are being requested, then a breakdown of resources and expenses with line-item requests is required either in the main NMDP or a supplementary proposal.

**Proposal status**. Depending on what stage your proposal is in, you must include:
* **Stage**. One of the following should be added: 1) Open for Comment, 2) Closed, 3) Open for voting, 4) Accepted, or 5) Rejected.
  * If you choose to conduct a signaling vote using Snapshot, please update status to Signaling Vote and link to that vote. Signaling votes can be used but are not required.
* If it is in the Open for Vote stage, add the link to the Snapshot proposal

### 3. Review and discussion period

An NMDP should be open for review and comment for at least seven days before transitioning your proposal to a Snapshot vote.

NMDPs can be in the open for comment stage for longer periods of time, but there is a minimum to ensure review, feedback, and discussion can occur before the proposal is moved to a Snapshot vote.

### 4. Snapshot vote

Once a proposal has been posted on Snapshot, members can vote on the proposal. Snapshot votes must be open for a minimum of five days before they close and the results are finalized.

### 5. Vote outcomes

An NMDP Snapshot vote requires a majority to pass. If a vote is accepted, then the member who posted the NMDP can reach out to the [Community team](/governance/dao-proposals#nmdp-templates) to receive a Utopia link, which will be used to request funds. 

## NMDP Templates

### Grant request

In addition to the required sections that are noted and outlined in [Posting an NMDP](/governance/dao-proposals#1-posting-an-nmdp), your grant proposal must include:

**Impact areas**. Projects should benefit the growth and development of the mutual but aren't limited otherwise. In this section, you should highlight why your proposal will benefit the mutual. Examples could include projects that increase awareness, improve education, create tooling, or provide technical improvements and/or functionality.
