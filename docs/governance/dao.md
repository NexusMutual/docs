# Nexus Mutual DAO

People join as members of the Nexus Mutual DAO and access the benefits of membership. Nexus Mutual is a member-driven protocol and DAO. People contribute to the protocol when they buy cover, underwrite risk, build risk management businesses, assess claims, or participate in governance.

Members who want to work to further the protocol's development, growth, awareness, or adoption can contribute to the DAO through a grant or a DAO team. Grants and teams are funded through the NMDP process; successful proposals receive funding from the DAO treasury (formerly referred to as the Community Fund).

People that contribute should help further the Nexus Mutual mission. Teams and contributors should share the Mutual's values.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide onchain protection against crypto risks and beyond.

## Values

Nexus Mutual members value:
* **Trust**–our commitment to transparency and our track record for paying claims should speak for itself, as we know we earn trust through our actions.
* **Egalitarian**–we are building an open protocol and DAO, so that protection is accessible by anyone.
* **Integrity**–we engage honestly with one another, keep our word, and always choose the right decision even when it's difficult.

## DAO treasury

The idea for the DAO treasury originated from a member's post on the [forum](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/nexus-mutual-community-fund/330). After the idea was discussed, [Proposal #116](https://app.nexusmutual.io/governance/view?proposalId=116) was voted on and passed by members to form a DAO treasury multisig and to mint 250,000 NXM for the treasury to use for grants.

Members decide what community projects and teams are funded from the treasury.

### Multisig signers

The treasury multisig signers were decided through a Snapshot vote. The community voted for the following members to act as the treasury multisig participants:
* [Roxana Danila](https://twitter.com/roxdanila)
* [DeFi Dad](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad)
* [Gauthier](https://twitter.com/Nedict0x)
* [BraveNewDeFi](https://twitter.com/BraveDeFi)
* [Richard Chen](https://twitter.com/richardchen39)
* [Adam Benayoun](https://twitter.com/adambn)
* [Deepcryptodive on behalf of kpk](https://x.com/deepcryptodive)

The multisig signers will sign off on, but not decide, which proposals pass and do not pass. They will enact the will of the wider Nexus Mutual community who vote with their NXM.

### DAO treasury address

The DAO treasury is managed across several multisigs, as noted below:
* [Original DAO Treasury Safe Multisig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x586b9b2F8010b284A0197f392156f1A7Eb5e86e9/balances): 0x586b9b2F8010b284A0197f392156f1A7Eb5e86e9

## Contributing to the DAO

Members can contribute to the DAO in a variety of ways. Reviewing governance forum discussions, providing comments and feedback, and voting in governance is an important way all members can contribute. [Our Head of Community offers several initiatives for people to get involved within Nexus Mutual and DeFi, as well](https://nexusmutualdao.io/calls-to-action). Check them out!

Those who want to put their talents and skills to work for the DAO can create an NMDP to request a grant for a single-purpose project or another purpose. Any grant proposal should highlight how someone's work will benefit the growth and development of the Mutual. Learn more about the NMDP grant process on the [Nexus Mutual DAO Proposals (NMDP)](/governance/dao-proposals) page.

Members can also contribute to an existing team or establish a new team that can serve the DAO for the long-term and provide a necessary function that is not being fulfilled within the DAO.

Before creating an NMDP team creation request, review the existing teams.

## DAO teams

Currently, there are four DAO teams. These teams work on behalf of Nexus Mutual DAO members, and their funding is approved through the NMDP process.

## DAO team funding

If the DAO team budget request proposals are approved by members through Snapshot governance, the DAO treasury sends funds to the team multisigs. With the [Q1 & Q2 2023 DAO teams budget request proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/community.nexusmutual.eth/proposal/0x63e292837175a2976c8857e0f3d565c7e5349fbf3671bcebae5505ed4dc97b12), members voted to streamline the payment process. All of the funding for DAO teams is held in the DAO teams multisig (formerly, the Community multisig) and payments are managed from that multisig.
